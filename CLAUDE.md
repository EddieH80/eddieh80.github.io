# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modern, minimalist portfolio template built with Astro and Tailwind CSS v4. It's designed to be easily customizable through a single configuration file while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: Static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework using the new @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe configuration
- **Tabler Icons**: Icon library

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build
```

## Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture with all customization centralized in `src/config.ts`:

- **Components** (`src/components/`): Individual Astro components for each section (Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Education, Header, Footer)
- **Scripts** (`src/scripts/`): Shared client scripts; `expandable.ts` powers the "Read more" toggles on project, experience, and education cards (a `data-expand-toggle` button whose `aria-controls` points at the clamped content)
- **Main Layout** (`src/pages/index.astro`): Single-page layout that imports all components
- **Configuration** (`src/config.ts`): Single source of truth for all content and customization

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Single Configuration File**: All content is managed through `src/config.ts` to make customization simple
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Sections automatically hide if their data is removed from the config
3. **Component Independence**: Each section is a self-contained component that reads from the config
4. **Accent Color System**: Single `accentColor` in config propagates throughout the site via CSS custom properties

## Important Implementation Details

- The site uses Tailwind CSS v4 with the Vite plugin configuration
- No linting or testing framework is currently configured
- All components are in `.astro` format (not React/Vue/etc)
- The project uses IBM Plex Mono font loaded from Google Fonts
- Social links in the config are all optional and will conditionally render

## Working with Components

When modifying components:
1. Components read directly from the imported `siteConfig` object
2. Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
3. Maintain the existing monospace font aesthetic
4. Use Tabler Icons for consistency with existing icons

## Configuration Structure

The `src/config.ts` exports a `siteConfig` object with these sections:
- Basic info: name, title, description, accentColor
- Social links: email, linkedin, twitter, github, resume (all optional; resume is a URL/path to a PDF, e.g. `/resume.pdf` in `public/`)
- aboutMe: string
- skills: string[]
- maxProjectsShown: number of projects shown before the "Show more" toggle (falls back to 5 if unset; set to 4 to fill the 2×2 grid)
- projects: array of {name, description, link, skills, tags?, image?} (tags drive the filter buttons)
- experience: array of {company, title, dateRange, bullets, image?, logo?}
- education: array of {school, degree, startDate, endDate, expected?, achievements, image?, logo?} (`dateRange` still works as a fallback)
